# Graveyard 
> aka. Foundary of Failed Creations

Welcome to the software project graveyard! 

I periodically update this page with completed, failed, deprecated or abandoned projects. Projects are sent to the graveyard for a variety of reasons including: 

* Feasibility
* Completion
* Unclear outlook
* Conflicts of interest
* General Conflicts
* etc

Software is beautiful, but, the real world is messy. 

## Why Bother Documenting?
I think its fun to reflect on some of the things you created.

## List
* Tradebay Book (2019-2021) - A book about building an algorithmic trading bot platform from scratch. I spent two years building the reference codebase and writing the book, unfortunately, in the end I cancelled the project due to external circumstances.
* Tradebay (2019-2021) - A Heroku for trading bots app. It was an algorithmic trading bot management and deployment system. It allowed a user to specify a trading strategy configuration and deploy an algorithmic trader from "the bay".
* Bitzen (2018-2019) -  A Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange. I wanted to understand how cryptocurrency exchanges worked so I built one for fun. It included an orderbook, exchange matching engine, blockchain wallet creation and monitoring system, and web application.
* Koi Self Learning (2018-2019) - A learning management system (LMS) based on a "units of education" framework for self directed learners. 
* Ethereum Open Transaction Insurance Market (2017-2018) - A peer to peer counter-party risk insurance marketplace. I tried building a marketplace in the pre-DeFi (PreFi?) Ethereum where a two parties could purchase counterparty insurance on transactions from a third party peer, and the third party peer could earn a premium. It was kind of like Nexus Mutual, but, aimed at real world transactions.
* Hibernate (2018) - Circadian rhythm alarm clock
* Consciousness (2018) - Immutable and pseudonymous social journaling. Think pseudonymous pen-pals via Blockstack (or OneName back-in-the-days :tm:)
* Posture (2017-2018) - An app to correct smart phone neck strain. 
* Flow (2016-2017) - Visual checklists
