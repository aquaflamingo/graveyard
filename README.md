Welcome to the graveyard! I really like building things, but, unfortunately [time is finite](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11241-everyone-must-leave-something-behind-when-he-dies-my-grandfather) and humanity's aperture of ideas is continually expanding (though the ideas themselves are strangely circuitous and derivative in form). As such, I periodically update this page with completed, deprecated or abandoned products, projects or ideas. Whenever possible, I try to [open](https://github.com/aquaflamingo/OpenRails) [source](https://github.com/aquaflamingo/OpenAndroid) things I don't want to work on as much in case folks want to learn from or reference them.

## List
* **Amplicon** (Retired, 2021) - A prototype for what "GitHub for Life Science" might look like. I had some interesting extension ideas in order to "fullstackize" Life Sciences (see [Biology Becomes Engineering](https://a16z.com/2018/03/23/when-how-biology-becomes-engineering/)), but, in the end I didn't feel I could dedicate enough effort to it, to make it shine.
* **Tradebay Book** (Abandoned, 2019-2021) - A book about building an algorithmic trading bot platform from scratch. I spent two years building the reference codebase and writing the book, unfortunately, in the end I cancelled the project due to external circumstances.
* **Tradebay** (Complete, 2019-2021) - A Heroku for trading bots app. It was an algorithmic trading bot management and deployment system. It allowed a user to specify a trading strategy configuration and deploy an algorithmic trader from "the bay".
* **Bitzen** (Complete, 2018-2019) -  A Bitcoin and Ethereum Exchange. I wanted to understand how cryptocurrency exchanges worked so I built one for fun. It included an orderbook, exchange matching engine, blockchain wallet creation and monitoring system, and web application.
* **Koi Self Learning** (Complete, 2018-2019) - A learning management system (LMS) based on a "units of education" framework for self directed learners. 
* **Cryptocurrency Candy Machine** (Complete, 2018) -  A gumball machine that accepted cryptocurrency payments with a Raspberry Pi and embedded servo motor.
* **Ethereum Open Transaction Insurance Market** (Abandoned, 2017-2018) - A peer to peer counter-party risk insurance marketplace. I tried building a marketplace in the pre-DeFi (PreFi?) Ethereum where a two parties could purchase counterparty insurance on transactions from a third party peer, and the third party peer could earn a premium. It was kind of like Nexus Mutual, but, for real world transactions.
* **Carebase** (Complete - 2018) - A primary medical care companion application. Manage prescriptions, appointments and health care information.
* **Hibernate** (Launched, 2018) - Circadian rhythm alarm clock
* **Consciousness** (Launched, 2018) - Immutable and pseudonymous social journaling. Think pseudonymous pen-pals via Blockstack (or OneName back in the days)
* **Posture** (Launched, 2017-2018) - An app to correct smart phone neck strain. 
* **Flow** (Launched, 2016-2017) - Visual checklists
